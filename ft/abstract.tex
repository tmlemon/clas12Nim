\begin{abstract}
  This document presents the technical layout and the performance of the CLAS12 Forward Tagger (FT). The FT,
  composed of an electromagnetic calorimeter based on PbWO$_4$ crystals (FT-Cal), a scintillation hodoscope
  (FT-Hodo), and several layers of Micromegas trackers (FT-Trk), has been designed to detect electrons and
  photons scattered at very small angles and to meet the physics goals of the hadron spectroscopy program and
  other experiments running with the CLAS12 spectrometer in Hall~B.
