\section{Requirements}

The CLAS12 DAQ requirements were initially defined for electroproduction experiments with a 10 kHz event rate and a 100 MB/s data rate, with livetime above 90\%. During detector construction the data rate requirement was upgraded to 200 MB/s. The data rate requirements were never officially changed, however the very first experiment showed that the initial design requirements were too low. This situation was anticipated by the developers and the system has been shown to be able to take data with an event rate of at least 20 kHz and a data rate of at least 1 GB/s, which meets the current experiment demand. The system has the potential for futher performance increases as well.
