\section{Performance}

The response of the LTCC to electrons and pions has been studied using experimental data from the spring run
2019 period, the first time that the LTCC sectors 3 and 5 were filled with the C$_4$F$_{10}$ gas. At the time
of this writing the data is not yet fully calibrated. However the CLAS12 detectors are sufficiently well calibrated
to understand several fundamentals aspects of the LTCC response.

\subsection{LTCC Response to Electrons}
\label{sec:elecResponse}

The electrons are selected using the reconstruction algorithms~\cite{recon-nim} that identifies electron tracks. The
LTCC response is calculated by checking whether the electrons produced a signal in the detector or not. The electron
momenta has been selected in the expected pion response range, between 3.5 and 8~GeV. The criteria for event
selection are:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Electrons identified using the reconstruction Event Builder algorithm;
\item Electrons must be within the geometrical fiducial volume of the LTCC.
\end{itemize}


The electron momentum spectrum before and after the requirement of an associated LTCC signal is shown in
\F{electronEfficiency}, along with a 0$^{th}$-order polynomial fit. The average efficiency for detection of
electrons in the LTCC is 94$\%$, slightly below the expected efficiency of 99$\%$. This may be due to
several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item the electron selection was not refined by using the calorimeters (due to the uncalibrated detector status);
\item possible impurities in the gas, which was not purified by the recovery system (unavailable at that time);
\item the data analyzed were not fully calibrated at the time of this writing;
\item the mirror overlaps and re-positioning issues mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:possibleInefficiency}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LTCC Response to Pions}

The determine the response of the LTCC to pions, reconstructed positively charged pions were selected and a check
was done on whether they produced a good signal in the LTCC detector. The positive pion selection considers all
positively charged particles that pass a neutron missing mass cut for the reaction $ep \to e'\pi^+n$. The criteria
for event selection are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The electron selection described in Section~\ref{sec:elecResponse};
    \item Positive pion candidates are identified using the reconstruction Event Builder algorithm;
    \item The positive pion candidates must be within the LTCC geometrical fiducial volume;
    \item A neutron missing mass cut is applied between 0.9 and 1.05~GeV (see \F{neutronMM}).
\end{itemize}

The missing mass cut is shown in \F{neutronMM}. The positive pion candidates that satisfy the cuts are shown in black
and those with a good LTCC cluster associated with the track are shown in red.

          between 0.95 and 1.05~GeV is selected for the efficiency analysis. The positive pion candidates that
          satisfy the cuts are shown in black. The pions associated with an LTCC signal are shown in red.}

			   normalized by the average electron efficiency of 94\% shown in \F{electronEfficiency}. }
	\label{fig:pionMomentum}
\end{figure}

The momentum distribution of the pions is shown in \F{pionMomentum} (top) for all pions and for the pions with an
associated signal in the LTCC. The ratio, normalized by the electron efficiency of 94\% found above to account for
other system inefficiencies, defines the LTCC pion detection efficiency as a function of momentum (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:pionMomentum} bottom). The LTCC response starts around 50\% near the expected signal threshold of
$\sim$3.5~GeV, and rises with momentum as expected, given that the number of emitted photons increases with
momentum. A plateau of 88\% is reached after a momentum of 5~GeV. This is within range of an expectation of
the expected efficiency above 90\%.
