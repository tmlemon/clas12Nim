\section{M{\o}ller Polarimeter}
\label{mollerpol}

The determination of the electron beam polarization is done in Hall~B using a coincidence M{\o}ller polarimeter.
The polarimeter is based on ${\vec e} + {\vec e} \to e + e$  elastic scattering (M{\o}ller scattering). A detailed
description of M{\o}ller scattering is presented in Ref.~\cite{Wagner:1990sn}.  

For a longitudinally polarized electron beam incident on a longitudinally polarized electron target, the 
center-of-momentum (CM) frame cross section is given by~\cite{moller32,kresnin57}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-csec}
 {{d\sigma}\over{d\Omega}}=
  {{d\sigma_0}\over{d\Omega}}\left(1+P_BA_{zz}P_T\right),
\end{equation}
where $d\sigma_0/d\Omega$ is the unpolarized cross section, $P_B$ and $P_T$ are the longitudinal components
of the beam and target polarization, respectively, and $A_{zz}$ is the analyzing power. The unpolarized cross section
and analyzing power can be precisely calculated through quantum electrodynamics, which gives
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-csecCM}
	\frac{d\sigma_0}{d\Omega}=\left(\frac{\alpha\left(3+\cos^2\theta_{CM}\right)}
						{2m_e\gamma\sin^2\theta_{cm}}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
%
and 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-Azz}
	A_{zz}=-\frac{\left(7+\cos\theta_{CM}\right)\sin^2\theta_{CM}}{\left(3+\cos^2\theta_{CM}\right)^2},
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, $\theta_{CM}$ is the CM polar scattering angle, $m_e$ is the
electron mass, and $\gamma=\sqrt{\left(E+m_e\right)/2m_e}$ with $E$ the lab energy of the incident
electron. From the above formulas, one sees that $A_{zz}$ has a maximum magnitude of $7/9$ at
$\theta_{CM}=90^\circ$, which is the central scattering angle for our polarimeter.

Forming the beam-helicity-dependent asymmetry gives
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-asymm}
A=\frac{\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}_+-\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}_-}{\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}_+
  +\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}_-}
	=A_{zz}\left(\theta_{CM}\right)P_B^zP_T^z,
\end{equation}
where the $\pm$ refers to cases where the beam helicity and the target polarization are aligned or anti-aligned.
The asymmetry can be measured from the yields according to
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-asymm-meas}
	A=\frac{N_+-N_-}{N_++N_-}=\langle A_{zz}\rangle P_B^zP_T^z,
\end{equation}
%
where $\langle A_{zz}\rangle$ is the effective analyzing power corrected for the finite-angle acceptance of the
polarimeter and atomic-electron motion (also known as the Levchuk effect~\cite{levchuk94}).

The CLAS12 M{\o}ller polarimeter detects the scattered electrons in coincidence near $\theta_{CM}=90^\circ$, the
peak of $A_{zz}$. The coincidence method has the advantage, as compared to single-arm M{\o}ller polarimetry, of
producing a clean data set without having to do energy-dependent background subtractions (see, for example
Ref.~\cite{arrington92}). Accidental background rates are typically less than 10\% of the real coincident rate for
our polarimeter. The accidental rate is measured and included as a correction.

\subsection{Polarimeter Design}
\label{sec-PolDesign}

The layout for the polarimeter is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-PolLayout}. The essential elements of the polarimeter include
a polarized target system, a pair of quadrupole magnets both operated in a dispersive mode to separate the
scattered electrons from the unscattered beam electrons, a pair of detectors, and lead shielding between the second
quadrupole and the detectors to reduce background. The detectors consist of scintillating fibers packed with lead
powder to form a 15.6-cm wide, 9.0-cm high, and 25-cm deep block with a light guide and are read out with a PMT. The
detectors are surrounded by lead bricks with a scattered-particle aperture of 7.62~cm in the horizontal direction and
5.0~cm in the vertical direction. The locations of the quadrupoles and detectors along with the quadrupole fields were
determined by simulations of the layout. The locations and fields were adjusted in the simulation so that
$\theta_{CM}=90^\circ\pm (4^\circ-4.5^\circ)$.

 \label{fig-PolLayout}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Polarimeter Target}
\label{sec-PolTgt}

The target system has a pair of 25-$\mu$m-thick permendur foils on a remotely controlled insertion table housed
in a vacuum chamber, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-MPtgt}. Permendur is an iron-cobalt alloy (49\% Fe, 49\% Co, 2\% Va)
that has a maximum saturated polarization of approximately 8\% along the plane of the foil when subjected to a
magnetic field of greater than about 40~G. To create a longitudinally polarized target, the plane of the foil is 
oriented at $\pm 20^\circ$ relative to the beamline and subjected to a longitudinal magnetic holding field produced
by a pair of Helmholtz coils on either side of the target chamber. Since only the longitudinal component of the
polarization contributes to the measured asymmetry, the target polarization used in Eq.~\ref{eq-asymm-meas} is
$P_T^z=P_T\cos 20^\circ$. The $ 20^\circ$ tilt angle of the target maximizes the longitudinal component of the
polarization, while keeping the mounting hardware out of the beam.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{MPtgt.pdf}
 \end{center}
 \caption{Side and top view layouts of the CLAS12 M{\o}ller polarimeter target chamber shown with the
   beam-left target inserted.}
 \label{fig-MPtgt}
\end{figure}

The polarization of the permendur target is related to the magnetization, $M$, of the foil by~\cite{Band:1997ee} 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-M2Pt2}
	P_T=M\left(4.546\times 10^{-5}\pm 2.9\times 10^{-7}\right),
\end{equation}
%
where $M$ is measured in units of G. The foil magnetization is measured in a separate setup consisting of a solenoid
coil used to produce the magnetizing field, $H$, into which the target foil is placed and a pickup coil that is located
at the center of the foil. A fixed current is applied to the solenoid to polarize the target. The direction of the
current is then flipped over a time period of $\sim$0.15~s leading to an induced voltage across the pickup coil. A
typical pickup-coil signal is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-TPolMeas}, which was measured with a digital oscilloscope. The
flat part of this signal (highlighted by the black constant fit) corresponds to the changing applied field while the
narrow peak in the middle of the signal results from the change in the target foil magnetization. Applying Faraday's
law to the flat part of the signal (using the fit to interpolate under the peak) yields
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-H}
	\int_H  Vdt=2HN_T \langle A_{\rm coil}\rangle\rightarrow H=\frac{\int_H Vdt}{2N_T\langle A_{\rm coil}\rangle} ,
\end{equation}
%
where $\int_H Vdt$ is the area under the pickup coil signal excluding the peak, $N_T$ is the number of turns in the
pickup coil, and $\langle A_{\rm coil}\rangle$ is the average cross-sectional area of the pickup coil.

The target polarization is related to the difference between the total area, $\int_{\rm total} Vdt$, of
Fig.~\ref{fig-TPolMeas} and the area leading to $H$ and is given by \cite{Band:1997ee} 
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq-PT}
	P_T=\left(1.474\pm0.010\right)l\frac{\left({\int_{\rm total} Vdt-\int_HVdt}\right)}{mN_T},
\end{equation}
%
where  $l$ is length of the target in cm, $m$ is the mass of the target in grams, and both areas are measured mVs. 
Figure~\ref{fig-PSat} shows a typical saturation curve for the target, i.e. how the target polarization depends on
the applied field. Measurements were done with two different pickup coils with the difference between the two
results indicating the systematic uncertainty associated with knowledge of the pickup coil geometry. For this foil,
the polarization saturated at a value of $P_T=6.17\pm 0.047$\%, where the uncertainty is a combination of the
statistical uncertainties from the linear fits of the saturation region of the curves and the variation between the
two measurements. Additional uncertainties associated with the leading factor in Eq.~\ref{eq-PT}, the other
measured quantities in Eq.~\ref{eq-PT}, estimated variations in the target material thickness, and the uncertainty
in the target angle relative to the beam leads to a total relative uncertainty $\delta P_T^z/P_T^z=0.014$.

\subsection{Analyzing Power Corrections and Uncertainties}
\label{sec-PolCor}

Simulations have been performed to estimate effects due to atomic motion of the electrons and to estimate
uncertainties associated with the polarimeter geometry. The simulation begins by randomly selecting the
scattering angles $\theta_{CM}$ and $\phi_{CM}$ and then transporting the scattered electrons through the
magnets and toward the detectors. For events in which both electrons hit the detectors, we determine an
average analyzing power, $\langle A_{zz}\rangle$. The motion of the atomic electrons has been included in the
simulation according to Ref.~\cite{levchuk94}. Figure~\ref{fig-Azz} shows $\langle A_{zz}\rangle$ as a function
of beam energy both with and without atomic-electron motion included in the simulation. The lower curve is a fit
to the points $\langle A_{zz}\rangle= -0.777123+(2.9249\times 10^{-3})/E$. The estimated relative uncertainty
is $<0.01$\% and was determined by looking at variations in $\langle A_{zz}\rangle$ for reasonable variations in
the geometry (locations of quadrupoles and detectors) and magnetic fields.

   curve on the lower points is a fit discussed in the text.}

\subsection{Beam Polarization Measurements}
\label{sec-SpinDance}

Beam polarization measurements are usually done on a weekly basis or after changes to the accelerator configuration.
The shift personnel use what is in essence a push-button GUI interface. The user selects which target to use (left
or right) and the Helmholtz coil polarity. The settings for the quadrupoles are automatically calculated based upon
the beam energy. Individual M{\o}ller runs are usually done for both targets with a statistical precision of
$\pm 1.5$\%, which is slightly smaller than the total systematic uncertainty. The underlying software calculates the
beam polarization using the beam-helicity-gated true and accidental coincidence rates from the M{\o}ller detectors
along with the beam-helicity related charge asymmetry measured using the SLM. At the end of a M{\o}ller run the
beam polarization is stored in the GUI and goes automatically to the electronic logbook. The scaler readouts during
the run are stored in the run file while the polarization measurement is stored in the database. 

The results of the beam polarization measurements taken during the fall 2018 run period are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:molrga}. There are two distinct regions of beam polarization with average polarizations of
$85.95\pm ~1.29\%$ and $89.22\pm~2.51\%$. These two regions differ by settings of the angle, $\theta_W$,
of the Wien filter in the injector. The initial Wien-filter angle was set to maximize the beam polarization in
Hall~B and was based on a calculation of the electron spin precession in the accelerator. However, the polarization
in the early part of the running period fell below the expected maximum of about 90\%, which was measured at the
injector by a Mott polarimeter, indicating an incorrectly calculated $\theta_W$. In order to find the optimum value
of $\theta_W$,  two more M{\o}ller measurements of the beam polarization in Hall~B were performed at
$\theta_W=25^\circ$ and $70^\circ$. The result of these measurements along with the average at
$\theta_W=50^\circ$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sdance}. Fitting these three points with a function of
$a\cos\left(\theta_W-b\right)$ (dashed curve), where $a$ and $b$ are fit parameters, shows that the maximum
polarization of about 90\% in Hall~B occurs for $\theta_W\approx 40^\circ$.

  the expected 90\% from the injector Mott measurements (black band). After optimizing the Wien-filter angle the
  average polarization measured in Hall~B was measured to be $89.2\%\pm2.5\%$ (stat.). The filled and open symbols
  correspond to measurements made with and without a half-wave plate, respectively. Error bars are statistical only.}

Figure~\ref{fig:molrga} has two sets of Hall~B polarimeter measurements done with and without a half-wave plate. The
half-wave plate rotates the electron spin by $180^\circ$. The measurements with and without the the half-wave plate
agree within statistical uncertainties.
